# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

Bootcamp Challenge 18

## Application Description

This application utilizes MongoDB to store data for my social media application. For this project, I created a back-end system that allows users to perform CRUD operations. The client can create new users for the social media application. The client can create thoughts (aka posts) and add reactions (aka comments) to thoughts.

If the client would like to delete a user along with their thoughts, they have the option to do so. They may also remove reactions to thoughts as well.

I hope you enjoy my application.
